# Skill Tree Concept

**The skill tree idea may or may not make it into the game.**

Skills:
* Clairvoyance (skry)
* Potion Making (food)

Each skill starts at 10 for each player. This means it costs 10 alter cards to perform a skill.
Each permenant (creature, item, ect) will have skill markers on it. Those skill markers reduce
the skill costs for as long as they are on the field.

For example a Hag card could have 1 potion marker and 1 clairvoyance marker. This would make the
players alter costs 9 for each of those skills. When that Hag is killed the alter costs for those
skills would go back up by 1.

No skill can ever cost less than 1 alter card to perform.
