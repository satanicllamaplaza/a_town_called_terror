# A Town Called Terror Card Game

A Magic The Gathering style card game that is accesible to first time players.

In a sleepy town called Terror several witches compete to be crowned The Queen of the Danmed.
Build your alter and summon the retched. If you can defend yourself and kill your oponents,
then you will rign over the town of Terror.

A Town Called Terror aims to keep as much of the Magic The Gathering functionality and play
style as possible, while relieving some of the more complicated aspects. It will have a large
collection of cards (600 in total) that are all unique. Instead of drafting or deck building
players will all draw from the same stack of cards. This will help game play begin immidiatly
and reduce the knowlege and skill required to have fun. This could be a great introductory game
for new magic players or a nice change of pace for veterans.
